# GiphyPicky

A ridiculously simple android app that uses the giphy sdk to search for gifs.

If launched by the user it will try and 'share' the selected image via the normal android share way. So, for instance, you can share an animated gif to an app that doesn't have gif selection capability built in.

If launched by another app that wants the user to pick an image file, it will return the selected image to the other app.

It requires a giphy sdk api key so you'll have to sign up for an account on giphy.com and produce an api key.
